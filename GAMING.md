GAMING GUIDE
=======

This is the building guide. For the complete documentation, please refer to **doc/document.pdf**.

First, you will enter the building scene. You can pick materials from the left. There are:

- Small Wooden Block
- Large Wooden Block -- You can use these blocks as scaffolding.
- Small Engine
- Large Engine -- Remenber to add these to provide force.
- Steel Ball
- Bomb -- Boom...
- Steel Stick
- Wooden Stick -- You can use these to connect things together.

Click on the material to get one of them, and click again on the space to put it down. Click on the right button to cancel this putting process. For sticks, you can draw lines with the cursor to connect things together. If you place an engine or a bomb, choose LETTER key to control it. For example, you can use key 'A' to start an engine or ignite a bomb. What's more, you can use the red cross on the lower-left to delete objects, or drag things with the cursor.

Note that different materials have different properties. Apparently steel is much heavier than wood, and is harder. When crash happens, things may be damaged. However, it's not apparently that a single flying steel stick has more probability to be damaged than a wooden block, because it have more momentum. You should also pay attention to the shape of what you build, because the shape of an objects in water is more important in 2D world than 3D. If you find unable to build a complex structure, try using wooden block as scaffolding.

Click LAUNCH button to battle. The structure you built will be saved to file, so you can improve on it again if you fail the battle. In battle, use the key you set to control your ship (or whatever...). Move to the right most site across the red line to win the game. The distance you have to move is approximately five times the width of the building area. If you feel despaired to win, for example you loose your engine, click the red cross on the upper-left to go back to building scene.

Currently there are 3 level: 0, 1, 2. When you win in one level, you will enter the next. Improve your ship and battle again! Attention: if you close the game, you have to go back to level 0.
